5. ✅ Enterprise Integration (Stripe, HubSpot, Trello, calendars, file storage)

## Key Platform Capabilities Based on Research
- **AI/ML**: Hugging Face (5,000 calls/day), Google Gemini (30 RPM), Groq (fast inference)
- **Data Sources**: GitHub API (5,000 req/hr), Alpha Vantage (financial), Weather, News
- **Communication**: Telegram Bot API, Discord webhooks, Teams integration
- **Documents**: Google Drive API, Azure Computer Vision OCR, PDF processing
- **Business Tools**: HubSpot API, Trello API, Google Calendar, financial data

## Design Requirements
- Modern, professional enterprise UI

- Focus on productivity, automation, data insights

## Next Steps
1. Create 3 design style options
2. Get user approval
3. Generate comprehensive design specification
4. Create design tokens JSON
5. Create content structure plan

## Status
✅ COMPLETED - Three-way hybrid design system implemented:
- Swiss Design (mathematical 8px grid, high contrast typography, sharp 0-4px borders)
- Modern Minimalism Premium (85% neutral colors, generous spacing, premium feel)
- Glassmorphism (selective frosted glass, layered depth, contemporary sophistication)

## Implementation Details
**Files Updated:**
1. `/workspace/docs/design-specification.md` - Updated to v2.0 with three-way hybrid
2. `/workspace/docs/design-tokens.json` - Added Swiss grid system, sharp borders, Swiss typography

**Key Changes:**
- Color distribution: 90/10 → 85% neutral / 12% primary / 3% semantic
- Added Swiss mathematical grid system (8px base unit, 64px columns, 24px gutters)
- Dual-mode border radius: Sharp (0-4px) for data areas, curved (8-24px) for interactions
- Swiss typography: Added Helvetica Neue as secondary font, data-specific sizes
- Three-way component strategy: Swiss structure + Minimalist colors + Glassmorphic effects

## Hybrid Strategy Implementation
1. ✅ Primary surfaces: Swiss grid + Minimalism colors/spacing
2. ✅ Interactive components: Glassmorphic hover states + elevated modals
3. ✅ Data visualization: Swiss precision + glassmorphic depth
4. ✅ Navigation: Minimalism structure + glassmorphic active states
