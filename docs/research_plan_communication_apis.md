## Research Completion Status
All phases completed successfully. Comprehensive analysis report generated covering:

✅ **Telegram Bot API**: Free service with robust features, rate limits, and enterprise applications  
✅ **Discord Webhooks & Bot API**: Free two-layer API system with advanced enterprise capabilities  
✅ **Slack API Free Tier**: Service exists but heavily restricted with recent API quota limitations  
✅ **Microsoft Teams Webhooks**: Being deprecated in favor of Workflows app and Power Automate  
✅ **Email APIs**: SendGrid free tier ended, Mailgun offers limited 100/day free tier  
✅ **SMS APIs**: Twilio offers test mode, MessageBird (Bird) is pay-as-you-go pricing

**Key Finding**: Most platforms have ended or heavily restricted their free tiers, requiring enterprise users to adopt paid solutions for production automation.
