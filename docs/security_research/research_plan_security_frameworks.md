# Research Plan: Security Frameworks for Enterprise Data Automation Systems

## Task Complexity: Complex
This research requires comprehensive analysis across multiple security domains, authentication systems, encryption methods, and compliance standards.

## Research Objectives
Analyze security frameworks for enterprise data automation systems with focus on:
- Role-based access control (RBAC) systems
- End-to-end encryption methods
- OAuth 2.0 and JWT authentication
- API security best practices
- Compliance standards (GDPR, HIPAA, SOC 2, ISO 27001)
- Secure data handling and API key management
- Audit trails and privacy protection mechanisms

## Research Plan
